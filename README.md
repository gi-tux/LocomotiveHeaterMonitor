# LocomotiveHeaterMonitor
This is a project to build a monitor system for a locomotive heater built from a pool heater for a railroad.

The application will be built using a Raspberry Pi and the Python programming language.  The system will need to monitor the air temperature as well as the input and output temperature of the water lines for two locomotives.
